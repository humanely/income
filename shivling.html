          <p>
            By grace of my Gurudev, Prabhu Nikhil, I am revealing the secret meaning of Shivling. It is very important to establish truth again and again throughout the time to guide the evolution of humanity and restoring balance in the universe.
          </p>

          <p>
            In a realm of time, many great sages and scholars have put concerted efforts to store the accrued knowledge of current generation along with giving a perspective to historical knowledge which also involves practicing it to through cultural heritage. But a lot of it is lost like tail of comet over a span of time, and  consequently a created void is gradually filled by new interpretations which imply to fit the missing data with derived knowledge. The quality of new derived knowledge depends on prevalence of tolerance in society for logical dispensation through complex and bitter facts. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In many times, history has distorted the meaning of the missing pieces to such an extent that the new profound theory got acceptance due to lack of counter-claims rather than proving the nullity of counter-claims.
          A crucial knowledge, which has been lost in our times, somewhere in last 5 millenniums, is about the meaning of Shivling. In current time of 2016 AD, not just the prevalent but only single majority of thought is that it is a phallic symbol. Though much worse and knowledgeably shameless arguments do exists, but it is better to rest them for sacredness of this dispensation to establish pure truth to create new knowledge. It is important to mention here itself, that this dispensation should also be not taken as word of God or divinity, but a re-effort to re-create the missing information and welcome counter-claims with very high regard so that a some future form of knowledge is accepted by society to course correct the destiny of our mankind. And it is important that everyone is able to put their claims and counter-claims.
          </p>

          <p>
            In current topology of codified knowledge, Shivling is an outer shape symbol derived from polar coordinate representation of Maheshwar Sutra(Figure 1). Sivaling has indisputable and explicit dimension and shape. Except artistic representation, the knowledgeably  supreme form of Shivling is unique. I am presenting to you this knowledge to fill the missing information for human society to preserve and practice. All further dispensation in this course is only to elaborate further with some more analogies and extension to few streams of codified knowledge, which can actually run in countless volumes. Further elaboration depends on needs of our times to focus on the short, medium and long term challenges which we can solve with this information. 

          </p>
          
          <b>
            Shape of Shivling 
          </b>          
          

          <p>
                      As succinctly explained earlier, Shivling is outer shape symbol derived from polar coordinate representation of Maheshwar Sutra. The forms one witnesses in temples and creatives are artistic and symmetric form of Shivling. The outer shape is made up of 14 points, which are respectively the positions of It-markers in Maheshwar Sutras. The inner space of Shivling contains the maheshwar sutra in an ordered arrangement which has inherent meaning and reasons to stay at particular location as per the Sutras. A deeper study also clears the doubts as raised by Katyayana(in Madhav Deshpande, 1997), for appearance of h(ह) twice or order of elements in fifth sutra. Like Shiva, Maheshwar Sutra is supreme truth. Shivling is supreme truth. By theory of induction, every entity linked to Shiva is absolute truth.

          </p>

          <b>
            Why is it called Ling?
          </b>
          
          <p>
            As we have already put forth our core theory that Shivling is the inherent meaning of maheshwar sutra in coordinate system, it can also be used to derive analytic functions to explain the world phenomena, e.g, standard model of quantum physics. But the name of Ling given has no relation to phallic, as propound by dark age theories.
           <p> Ling in sanskrit, means symbol.</p>
          To understand the reason of naming the maheshwar sutra model as Ling, we must understand the ontology of that time. Unlike our current time, the past era had lesser taxonomical relations to sex organs. The mention of sex organs could not have created negative connotations of mischief or sin, but only a well understood human part which has greater role, than ours in limited ontological society. By limited ontology, I mean to highlight the branches of knowledge in physical materialistic world, and also it signifies that the past ontology would have been far more deeper in spiritual body of knowledge. Whereas, our current spiritual ontology is obviously far less shallower, given that we have lost a humongous treasure of that culture and knowledge. And it is the sole reason, that naming sutra model as Shivling, signified the essence of Lord Shiva as creator of universe and all seeds of creations come from him. 
          </p>
          

          <b>
            Manifestation of Shivling in universe - Shivling is everywhere
          </b>
          
          <p>
            It is imperative to ask in material sense to manifest Shivling around us, at least for proofs. Since Shivling has been made most sacred means of worship and one where Shiva resides himself, Shivling has to be a physical manifestation of something which must be existing in every particle of the universe. And it is indeed so, as Shivling represents all the forces of our nature arranged in an order so that one can truly derive detailed knowledge. State of every particle is described by the Maheswar Sutra and as such Shivling is an analytic representation of those formula.
          </p>
          

          <b>
            Creation of Universe
          </b>
          
          <p>
            The creation of this universe as well as all others, has happened through the sounds generated by damaru of Shiva. And as such, Shivling is sacred in all universes. And all universes are created and destroyed by Shiva. Therefore, it is imperative that different universes are governed by different principles, but universal constants are indeed decided by order of sounds produced by the daaru of Shiva. Therefore, sacredness of Shivling is linked to sacredness of knowledge of creation of every particle in this universe.

          <p>ॐ नमः शिवाय</p>
          As the purpose of this first introduction is to immerse into supreme truth to cleanse historical inaccuracies of knowing and interpreting Shivling, I have touched many topics briefly. In coming series of dispensations, I will be providing proofs and elaborations based on structured topics.
